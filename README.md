#  👋 Hello! Welcome to my space👋
## 🙋🏻‍♀️ I am a 🥼 Cell Biologist who found her passion in 📊 Data Analitics and 💊 Clinical Research fields
### 👩🏻‍🎓 Join me in this journey as I practice learned coding skills and enter the Data Analysis field
### 🧐 Personal philosophy: Happiness is an inside Job ☀️ (working on it 😬) 

👸🏻 I bit about me:
I am a Cell Biolgist graduated in 2007, I have always have an interest in Data Analysis and have done it in some level in each of my professional roles. I started with Excel, learning everything by consulting with "San Google" 🔍 if and how I was able to do something, and sucedeed on creating a predictive program in excel to estimate times to collect yeast in a Brewery 🍺 based on historic fermentation rates 📉 (several cicles through the years).

As I get bore easily with repetitive tasks 😶, I started to investigate how to automate those and dive a bit more in excel with macros to program some data cleaning activities, some data analysis tasks and automated charts and reports 🤖, needing few human manipulation and reducing human error 👀. 

My recent experience was in Clinical Research, a field that I like and that I was able to dabble in the mist of the pandemic 😷, a field where a lot of data is handdle, verified (by all means neccesary) and analyzed in order to have data-backed new safe and effective medicines and therapies available for multiple deseases 💉. My rol was Clinical Research Associate, however, what I enjoyed the must was the Data Management support that I could give, dealing with systems and reports, comparing and searching for and solving discrepancies; oh, and I can´t complaint on the work from home benefits of the DM team 🛋️.

After analysing profundly what I really have liked in each of my professional roles I realized that Data, Excel, Systems are the things that I enjoyed the must, so I decided to persue the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification with Coursera 🤓, program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process including a hands-on activities [(please see my case study repository 📋)](https://github.com/XolSM/Google-Data-Analytics-Certificate). I realized that I actually knew more than I expected about Data Analysis 🤯 and that I am always applying the required soft skills like analytical/problem-solving skills, critical thinking, attention to detail, fast learning and adaptability, great communication skills to wokr individually or as a team member 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.

So now, I continue to learn and practice skills that will allow me to perform and success as a Data Analyst 🙌🏼 and I am currently looking for new challenges and opportunities that involve Data Analysis 💪🏽 to continue growing in this field that I am passionate about 🤩.
