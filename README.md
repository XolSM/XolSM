## 👋 Hello! Welcome to my space👋
## I am a 🥼 Cell Biologist who found her passion in 📊 Data Analytics, Programming and 💊 Clinical Research
### I'm currently studying a PBD in Computer and Information Systems - Data Analytics stream

A bit about me:
I am a Cell Biologist that have always have an interest in Data Analysis. I started in the data field by working with Excel, learning everything by consulting with "San Google" 🔍 if I was able to do something and how, and succeeded on creating a little program on excel to estimate times to collect yeast in a Brewery 🍺 based on the historic (several cycles throughout several years) and current fermentation rates 📉, helping Brewers with effective planification.

As I get bore easily with repetitive tasks, I started to investigate how to automate those and dive a bit more in excel with macros to program some data cleaning activities and data analysis tasks, as well as automating charts and reports to need fewer human manipulation and thus reducing human error 🤖. 

My recent experience was in Clinical Research, a field that I like and that I was able to dabble in the mist of the pandemic 😷, a field where a lot of data is handle, verified (by all means necessary) and analyzed in order to have data-backed new safe and effective medicines and therapies available for multiple diseases 💉. I have realized that what I've enjoyed the most is the Data Management support that I could give, dealing with systems and reports, comparing and searching for and solving discrepancies; oh, and I can´t complaint on the work from home benefits.

So, I decided to pursue the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification with Coursera 🤓 and I realized that I actually knew more than I expected about Data Analysis 🤯 and that I am always applying the required soft skills like analytical/problem-solving skills, critical thinking, attention to detail, fast learning and adaptability and great communication skills, and decided to further pursue it by studying a Post-Baccalaureate Diploma in Computer and Information Systems - Data Analytics stream in Douglas College. 

So now, I continue to learn and practice skills that will allow me to perform and success as a Data Analyst, and I am currently looking for new challenges and opportunities that involve Data Analysis to continue growing in this field that I am passionate about.
